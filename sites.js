Snow, who had been in and out of trouble for a few years and who desperately needed money, was carrying his father’s pistol.

Although sentenced to die in the newly-invented electric chair, Snow’s sentence was commuted. Thomas C. Day of Barnstable was Snow’s attorney, but his connection to the family predates the trial: in 1895, Day bought the Snow family’s house with the provision that they could purchase it back from him within a year for the same price plus interest.
